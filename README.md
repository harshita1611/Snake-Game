Hey there! Do you remember playing the classic Snake game on your Nokia phone during your childhood? 
I certainly do, and I have created a version of that game using the Turtle module in Python. 
This repository includes four files: main, snake, food, and scoreboard. 
These files keep track of the snake's movement, the snake's body, the food's appearance, location, and score of the player. 
I hope you enjoy playing this game!
